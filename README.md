# PandaQ-SQL-interpreter-in-Python-
This project implements an interpreter for a subset of SQL queries. To consult table information, files in `csv` format will be used. In addition, the interface has been made with the Streamlit library. At the code level, the treatment of the tables has been carried out thanks to the Python Pandas library.
